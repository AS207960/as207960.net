# Peering with us

We have an open peering policy, which means that in general we're happy to peer with anyone
who expresses interest on a few conditions:

* You have an [PeeringDB](https://peeringdb.com) entry.
* Your NOC contact is up to date and responsive to issues within a reasonable timeframe.
* You publish accurate and up to date routing policies in the relevant RIRs registry.

If you wish to peer with us drop us an email, and we'll sort it out shortly.
