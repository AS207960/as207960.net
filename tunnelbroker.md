# Tunnelbroker

We can provide routed IPv6 prefixes and BGP peering via tunnels on request.
Connection is possible via GRE or WireGuard.
Please email us to request a tunnel.

## Routed IPv6

We can give a prefix from our own address space to you, anywhere from a /64 to a /56
(longer available upon justification).

## BGP

If you have your own ASN and some public IPv4/IPv6 space we're happy to provide you with
a tunnel in which to peer with us over for hobby purposes, subject to our standard 
[peering policy](/peering).
